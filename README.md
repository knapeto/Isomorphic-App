Experimentation with webpack, react with server side rendering, backbone router and asynchronous loading of routes on the client side.<br/>

1. Uses require.ensure feature of webpack to load each route asynchronously,<br/>
2. Uses react to do server side rendering.<br/>

More experimentations todo:<br/>
1. Load react state/data/props asynchronously on server side and pass them onto client to initialise the components.<br/>
2. Package child components styles to be loaded asynchornously as well.<br/>
